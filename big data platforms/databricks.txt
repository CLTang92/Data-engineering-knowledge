#####DATABRICKS####################

- analyse data
- derives insights using SparkSQL
- build predictive models using SparkML
- provide active connections to visualization tools such asa PowerBI, Tableau, Qlikview etc.

Advantages of Databricks
- Support for the frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy), scripting languages (eg. R, Python, Scala or SQL) tools and IDEs (JupyterLab, Rstudio)
- Delivers a Unified Data Anlalytics Platform, data engineer, data scientists, data analysts, business analysts can work in tandem on the same notebook.
- Flexibility across different ecosystems- AWS, GCP, Azure
- Data reliability and scalability through delta lake
- basic built-in visualization
- AutoML and model lifecycle management through MLFLOW
- 10X Faster ETL's


###DATABRICKS INFRASTRUCTURE####
- databricks gather different types of data (eg. payment data, order data, product data, customer data) and do transformation, analyze, process, thereafter, maybe go to mlflow, datawarehousing or link to visualization.


------------------------------
data analyst -
huge amount of data - cleaning, transform, process
requirement:
kpi - active customer
eg. 
how many customer done purchase
how many customer viewing product

each day - dumping data -table, now this data connecting to tableau

in databricks can create notebook -- schedule (daily, weekly or monthly)


-----------------------------------

data engineer-
migration data, etl
process

databricks - faster etls

connect jdbc connection - get data from sql server to cloud #migration activity
- can use databricks environment to select multiple nodes and driver, can faster activity and process easily, available easily and quickly

can write code in pyspark, spark sql, scala, r

-------------------------------------------------

data science -
scikitlearn libraries
python libraries
predictive modeling
mlflow
---------------------------------------------------

Databricks runtime version:  #use default
- click "Create cluster"
7) #now create notebook
- go to left panel, select" Create" - "Notebook"
- at the top, can rename the notebook to "databricks projects", at the right can select what language eg. Puthon, SQL, Scala, R
#This case select Python

8) At the right side, can see "Starting", can see "databricksproject" cluster still running, once done only select then only can execute at notebook


###DO project#############
KPI:
1. Gender category distribution of taking loan
2. Top occupation taking loan
3. Top loan category on which loan taken
4. Which marital status category people taking loan

#############

At databricks - notebook


##create table
1) Go to left panel - "Data" - "Create Table"
2) Now got different options:  "Upload file", "S3" and "Other Data Source", click on "Upload file" and upload the data file we want, the click "Create table with UI"
3) Under "Select a CLuster to Preview the Table"
Cluster: databricksproject
- and click "Preview table"
4) Under "Specify Table Attributes"
Table name: Loan analysis #any name
Create a Database: "default"
File type: CSV #this case is CSV
Column Delimiter: #empty
- Check on "First row is header #if the header didn't show as header in the preview
- Check on "infer schema" #if already auto-detect the data type of each field
- Click "Create Table"

##go to notebook and run some SQL##
1) Left panel select "Recents" - "databricks projects"
2) show tables #see what table we have
3) select * from loan_analysis #show data in the table "loan_analysis"
4) describe loan_analysis #show schema of the "loan_analysis" table (column name, data type and comment)

=======================================
###Do analysis###

Q1. Gender category distribution of taking loan

1) Click on the right arrow down button - "Show title"
2) Rename "Untitled" to "gender wise distribution loan"
3) run query:
select gender, sum(Loan) from loan_analysis
group by gender

4) result here is in table format, can visualize it by clicking "+" - "Visualization"
** Visualization type: Bar, Y columns: gender, x columns: sum(Loan), Group by: gender
* if want to show data label, can go to "Data Labels" tab can check on "Show data labels"
- then click "Save"

----------------------

Q2. Top occupation taking loan (Top 10 only)


1) Click on the right arrow down button - "Show title"
2) Rename "Untitled" to "top occupation of taking loan"
3) run query:

#show how many types of occupation
select distinct occupation from loan_analysis

#select top 10 occupation taking loan

3) run query:

#show how many types of loan category
select distinct 'loan category' from loan_analysis #if there is a spacing on the column name, need to use single quote ''

#show top 5 sum(loan) distribution by category
select 'loan category', sum(Loan) from loan_analysis
group by 1 #means 'loan category'
order by 2 desc #2 means by 2nd column which is sum(Loan)
limit 5


4) result here is in table format, can visualize it by clicking "+" - "Visualization"
