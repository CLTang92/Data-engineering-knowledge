Databases vs. Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes

Database
- database itself or dbms
- relational database store data in table (fixed row and column)
- no relational database (noSQL) stores data in variety model eg. JSON, BSON, key-value pairs, table with rows and dynamic 

columns and nodes and edges
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to ensure data integrity
- Relational databases: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL
- Document databases:  MongoDB and CouchDB
- Key-value databases: Redis and DynamoDB
- wide-column stores: cassandra and hbase
- graph databases: neo4j and Amazon neptune


Data warehouses and data lakes
- support online analytical processing (OLAP)
- OLAP collect data from different variety of sources, a range analytical use cases from business intelligence and reporting to forecasting

data warehouse
- a giant databases that optimized for analytics
- store current and historical data from 1 or more system
- ETL processes move data from its original source to data warehouse
- business analyst can connect to data warehouses with BI tools, looks insights and generate report
- highly structured
- x intended to transaction and concurrency needs
- EG. Snowflakes and Amazon Redshift
- create etl processes to move data to data warehouse 

Data lakes(like data warehouse but store data in original, raw format)
- repository of data from disparate sources, stores original data format eg. Json, bson, csv, tsv, avro, orc, and parquet, can store databases
- Primary purpose is analyze data to gain insights
- cheap storage
- eg. Starburst, presto, atlas data lake can give database like view.
- can form storage layer for database
- data not need to transform to add to data lake
- data can be processed on variety of OLAP systems and visualized with BI tools.
- support machine learning and predictive analytics 
- same as data warehouse, x intended to transaction and concurrency needs of an application
- storage and compute capabilities
- Storage: eg. Aws s3, Azure data lake storage gen2, Google cloud storage 
- organizing and querying data eg. MongoDB Atlas data lake, aws athena, presto, starburst, databricks sql analytics
- may not require data to be moved eg. MongoDB Atlas data lake able to access data stored in amazon s3 bucket
