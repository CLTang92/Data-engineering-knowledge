How to query s3 data from Amazon Athena using SQL
______________________________________________________


*Using Amazon Athena no need to move data from S3 to any database, data still sitting in S3, just create a table on top of it interactively querying data


Steps:

1) Upload dataset (eg. csv file) to S3
- Go to S3 bucket, create a new folder
Folder name: #any name
click on "Create folder"
- Upload data to this folder, click on "Add files", select the file and click "Upload"

2) Go to Amazon Athena console, under "Get started"
- select "Query your data" and click on "Launch query editor"

3) Under "Amazon Athena" - "Query editor", need to create table catalog first

###########create table catalog for the file uploaded###################

#create crawler
- Go to left panel of Amazon Athena, under "Tables and views", click "Create" and select "AWS Glue Crawler" #Glue crawler scan the uploaded file infer the schema and create a table
- Under "Add information about your crawler"
Crawler name: data-crawler #any name
click "Next"
Crawler source type: select "Data stores" #catalog not existing
Repeat crawls of S3 data stores: select "Crawl all folders"
click "Next"
Choose a data store: select "S3"
Connection: #no need to select
Crawl data in: select "Specifies path in my account"
Include path:  s3://xxxxxxx/<folder_name>/ #****select the folder where the file located, add "/" at the back so call all files in the folder 
click "Next"
Add another data store: select "No"
click "Next"
Choose an IAM role: select "Create an IAM role" #can select existing IAM role if vailable
AWSGlueServiceRole-<any name> #any name, eg. data-crawler-iam-role
*auto create IAM role and grants all require permissions eg. scan s3 folder for schema, as well as create table and etc
**to create role, must have "CreateRole", "CreatePolicy" and "AttachRolePolicy" permissions
click "Next"
Under "Create a schedule for this crawler" - "Frequency": select "Run on demand" #run only when is needed
click "Next"

Under "Configure the crawler's output"
- Database:  select "Add database" #where the table will be added
Database name: xxxx_db #any name
then click "Create"
click "Next" and click "Finish"
#crawler created

#run crawler
4) Under AWS Glue - Crawlers, check on the crawler created (status is "Ready"), then click on "Run crawler"
5) Refresh the crawler by clicking icon "refresh" at the right, until it is completed and status back to "Ready", then it will auto create table in Amazon Athena
*can see the table at "AWS Glue"-"Tables" (Under left panel, "Data Catalog"-"Databases"-"Tables")
###############################

6) back to Amazaon Athena - left panel under "Data", click icon "Refresh"
- Data source: AwsDataCatalog
- Database: #select database created
#now can see the table created, can expand the table to see schema imported
##so the table is auto created with schema being imported

##***running query in Amazon Athena need to configure query output location where store result in S3
7) At "Amazon Athena" - "Query editor", go to "Settings" tab , click on "Manage" button and set "Query result location" eg. s3://athena-results-xxxx/

#start query
1) At "Amazon Athena", click on "Editor" tab
2) Under table, there is 3 dots button next to table name, click on it and select "Preview Table" #preview table
3) can start to write sql query and run
eg. SELECT * FROM "xxxxx_db"."data" where xxxxxx = 'xxx'  #"data" is the table name in this example
