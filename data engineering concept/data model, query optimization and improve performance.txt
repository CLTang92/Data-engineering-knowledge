Data model
1) relational model - normalized
2) dimensional model - star schema, snowflake schema, denormalized, got fact (quantify of data, measurement eg. Quarterly sales data number) and dimension (who, what and where of fact)


Star schema
- 1 fact table, multiple dimension tables
- query data faster with simpler queries than normalized database design
- denormalized, repeating of same values within a table 
- simple query writing
- more storage space
- data integrity issue

Snowflake schema
- similar to star schema, but it splits dimensional tables into further dimensional tables (also called lookup tables)
- each dimension split until it is normalized, no redundancy
- more complex query design
- less storage space

Query optimization and improve performance
- less join
- join start with smaller table
- data type don't use too large if not required
- avoid subqueries 
- avoid null, use 0, empty string or other specific value
