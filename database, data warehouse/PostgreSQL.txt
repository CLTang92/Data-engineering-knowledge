PostgreSQL

1) count (*) - include null value, count (column name) - not include null value

2) LIKE is case sensitive, ILIKE not case sensitive,  % is zero or more character, _ only 1 character, [ ] accept any character in the list eg. [cno] accept com, net and org. Wildcard characters are %, _ , [ ]


3) between is inclusive eg BETWEEN 10 AND 20, included 10 and 20

4) SELECT  ...., payment_date FROM payment WHERE EXTRACT(year from payment_date) =2022;


5) default order is ASC

6) <> same as !=

7) aggregate functions-AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM, cannot select other column 

out, only can select those column with aggregate function, eg MIN(column name)  MAX(column name)

8) GROUP BY - use COALESCE to handle nulls, use WHERE clause to filter data before grouping, use HAVING clause to filter aggregated results after grouping

9) DATE(column name) - to get only the date from timestamp

10) SELECT SUM(column name) FROM ...
ORDER BY SUM(column name), need to include aggregate function of the particular column to ORDER BY, cannot just use column name, need to use SUM(column name) to order by

11) filter aggregated function in HAVING
Not Where clause, because need to go 

through group by clause first
SELECT ....
GROUP BY..
HAVING SUM(column name) > ..;

12) AS - to rename, but when using HAVING can't use the new name, use back aggregated function,  eg. SUM(column name), AS only executed at last.
