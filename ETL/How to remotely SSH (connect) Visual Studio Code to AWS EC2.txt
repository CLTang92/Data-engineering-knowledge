#HOW TO REMOTELY SSH(CONNECT) VISUAL STUDIO CODE TO AWS EC2
1) Download visual studio code, sign up aws account

2) #create EC2 instance
- go to AWS, search EC2, click on "Launch Instance"
Name: remote-connect #any name
Application and OS images (Amazon Machine Image): Ubuntu
Amazon Machine Image: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - Free tier eligible
Architecture: 64-bit (x86)
Instance Type: t2.micro - Free tier eligible
Key pair (login) - create new key pair

Key pair name: testing_remote_connect #any name
Key pair type: RSA
Private key file format: .pem, then click "Create key pair"
*auto download .pem file
Firewall (security groups): select create security group, check on "Allow SSH traffic from Anywhere 0.0.0.0/0", then click "Launch instance"

3) Go EC2/instance, refresh the page, check whether the status of the instance is running.


#######To double check whether the EC2 Instance is running before connect to Visual Studio Code, try to use command line (cmd) in local computer to connect.
- go to local pc command prompt (search by cmd) and open it

- go to aws ec2 instance, check on the particular ec2 instance and click on "Connect" button. Under SSH client tab, there is a line to connect, under Example ssh-i .....pem ..... #.pem is the file that downloaded just now

- go to command prompt 
cd Downloads #the folder that stores .pem file

- Copy and paste ssh-i....pem.... (from aws ec2 instance connect/SSH Client) in command prompt, then key in "yes" to continue
**if show "ubuntu@ip-xxxxxxx" means connected ec2 instance in command line

#to show, type "ls" #nothing to show right now, is empty

#create a "learning" folder in ecs2 instance
mkdir learning #create "learning" folder
ls #list the folder

#go to "learning" folder
cd learning/
touch test_etl.py #create a python file in "learning" folder
ls #list file
nano test_etl.py #to write in this file, press ctrl+X to exit


#######cmd prompt is able to connect to ec2#########

4) go to visual studio code, click on left panel last icon "extensions" icon, then search for "Remote - SSH" then install

5) After install, go to bottom left corner. Click on icon "Open a remote window", then in the center of screen, click on "Connect to Host.." - "Configure SSH Hosts.."- Select "C:\Users\<my computer username>\.ssh\config" #select configuration file to update

- in the config file, type below and save

Host remote-connect #put ec2 instance name
	Hostname xx.xxx.xx.xxx #need to indent #this is under the particular ec2 instance, tab "Details", public ipv4 address, copy and paste here
	User ubuntu #user of ec2 instance #since created using ubuntu, so is ubuntu #go to particular ec2 instance, under tab "Details"- "Platform"
	IdentityFile C:\...â€¦\xxx.pem #filename is the .pem file downloaded with path


6) go back to bottom left corner. Click on icon "Open a remote window", then in the center of screen, click on "Connect to Host..", now the ec2 instance name is shown, select it

Under "Select the platform of the remote host "<ec2 instance name eg.remote-connect>""- select "Linux" #go to particular ec2 instance, under tab "Details"- "Platform Details": Linux/UNIX

###now will try connecting, once connect will show SSH: <ec2 instance name> at bottom left of Visual Studio Code#####

7) ### to verify connection of visual studio code and EC2 instance
- Go to tab "Terminal" - New Terminal
- at terminal will show ubuntu@ip-xxx.xx.xx.xxx
- ls #type ls in terminal to show just now the "learning" folder created when using command prompt
- #go to "learning" folder
cd learning/
ls # show the file in "learning" folder


###after connected, can go into the folder###
- click on tab "File"
- select "Open Folder..."
- at the right there is a bar let us select which folder to open "/home/ubuntu/, if select "learning" folder - ok

- "Do I trust author of the files.." checked and click yes
####now can see the python file in the folder, can click on the python file and do coding

1) click on the python file and write code
Eg.
print("Testing")

2) save and go to tab "Terminal" - "New Terminal", the terminal already in "learning" folder directory, type below to run the python file to show print result.

python3 test_etl.py


###download file from EC2 instance to personal computer (in Visual Studio Code)
- can go to python file and right click 

"Download.." and choose location to download 

#upload file from personal computer to EC2 instance (in Visual Studio Code)
- just drag and drop to the folder

#delete file from EC2 instance (in Visual Studio Code)
- just right click the file and choose "Delete permanently"

#create folder and file in EC2 instance (in Visual Studio Code)
- can just click on New folder/New file icon on the left panel
